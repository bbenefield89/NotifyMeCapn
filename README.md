### Introduction

**NotifyMeCapn** is a note taking web app. This is a great project for anyone getting started with server side languages to really familiarize themselves with the basics of CRUD. This particular project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP and it is meant to replicate the same functions one would find while using EverNote or SimpleNote.

### Current Operations
- Read (SELECT) data from the database and display the information.
- Create (INSERT) data using prepared statement and validated user input. Currently a user can sign up, login, create new notes, and write content in those notes.
- Update (UPDATE) data in the database. Currently users can update their notes titles and the content of the notes.
- Delete (DELETE) data from the database. Currently users can completely delete a note including the title and content.

### Plans for the future
- Use AJAX to create a seamless experience.
